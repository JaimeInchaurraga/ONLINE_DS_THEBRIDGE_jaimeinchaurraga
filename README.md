Welcome to my Data Science Bootcamp repository! This repository contains all the content and projects I completed during The Bridge Data Science Bootcamp, one of the most prestigious bootcamps in the field. The program lasted for 7 months and provided a comprehensive learning experience through a blend of theory and practical applications.  

Bootcamp Structure  

The bootcamp was divided into several key modules, each focusing on different aspects of Data Science:  
- Basic Programming: Fundamentals of Python programming, data structures, and algorithms.  
- Advanced Programming: More complex Python programming concepts including object-oriented programming, libraries, and frameworks.  
- Data Extraction, Cleaning, and Analysis: Techniques for gathering, cleaning, and processing data using libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and SQL.  
- Machine Learning: Building predictive models using algorithms like regression, classification, clustering, and more, with tools such as Scikit-learn and TensorFlow.  
- Deep Learning: Neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNN), and natural language processing (NLP), including hands-on projects with TensorFlow and Keras.  

Weekly Sprints and Projects  

Each module was composed of weekly sprints, where we focused on learning new concepts and applying them to real-world problems. Every week consisted of:
- Programming Exams: Regular assessments to evaluate our understanding of coding and problem-solving skills.  
- Weekly Assignments: Practical exercises and challenges submitted for grading.  
- Live Classes: Weekly sessions with instructors to guide us through the more difficult concepts and provide insights.  
- Group Projects: Team-based projects where we collaborated to solve complex data challenges.  

Capstone Projects   

The bootcamp also included two major personal projects, which required extensive research, analysis, and presentations. These capstone projects were designed to showcase our skills in real-world applications of Data Science.  

Additional Workshops and Classes  

Throughout the program, we participated in additional workshops and attended extraordinary classes to delve deeper into specialized topics and expand our knowledge beyond the core curriculum.  

Conclusion  

This repository showcases the journey I undertook throughout the bootcamp, including code, projects, and notes from each of the modules. It reflects the intensive and enriching experience provided by The Bridge Data Science Bootcamp and the wide range of skills I acquired during the 7-month program.
Feel free to explore the repository and check out the different modules, projects, and capstone work!
